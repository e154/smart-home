These methods are often used to ensure security and protect data in the "Smart Home" system.

1. `Encrypt(val)`: This method is used for data encryption. It takes a value (`val`) as input and encrypts it, typically to ensure the security of confidential information or data.

2. `Decrypt(val)`: This method is used for data decryption. It takes the encrypted value (`val`) as input and decrypts it, returning it to its original state.

Example of using the `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` methods in the "Smart Home" system in the JavaScript programming language:

```javascript
// Data Encryption
const originalData = "Secret Information"; // Original data
const encryptedData = Encrypt(originalData); // Encryption

console.log("Original Data:", originalData);
console.log("Encrypted Data:", encryptedData);

// Data Decryption
const decryptedData = Decrypt(encryptedData); // Decryption

console.log("Decrypted Data:", decryptedData);
```

In this example, we first encrypt the string "Secret Information" using the `Encrypt` method. Then we decrypt the encrypted data using the `Decrypt` method. After decryption, we get the original data back.
