In the JavaScript environment, there is a function called `marshal` that converts an object into its JSON representation
using the `JSON.stringify` function.

Here's an implementation example of the `marshal` function:

```javascript
function marshal(obj) {
  return JSON.stringify(obj);
}
```

Here's an example of using the `marshal` function:

```javascript
var obj = { name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" };
var jsonStr = marshal(obj);
console.log(jsonStr); // {"name":"John","age":30,"city":"New York"}
```

In this example, the `marshal` function takes an object `obj` and uses the `JSON.stringify` function to convert the
object into its JSON representation. The result of the function will be a JSON string containing the serialized data of
the object.
